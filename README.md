This was the third task of my internship, where I learned to build a simple REST API using Node.js and Express. I created a basic server that handles a list of books stored in an in-memory array, with support for CRUD operations. The API includes routes to fetch all books, add a new book, update an existing one by ID, and delete a book. I used Postman to test the endpoints and understood how HTTP methods and route handling work in Express. This task helped me get hands-on experience with server-side development and working with JSON data.
